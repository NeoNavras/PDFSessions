# PDFSessions
A javascript for Adobe Acrobat Reader that enables the user to save sessions (groups of open pdfs) and later restore them. Based on the script by Andrey Kartashov found in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12689154/adobe-acrobat-reader-tabs-saving-and-autoloading.

Just add the script to the Javascripts directory under your Adobe Acrobat Reader installation (for Adobe Acrobat Reader it should be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\Javascripts), restart the application and use the new "Save Session", "Open Session" and "Delete Session" options on the Window menu.
